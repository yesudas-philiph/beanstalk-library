Concepts I came across during this deployment
------------------------------------------------

>first of all configure the network then only proceed further

>elastic beanstalk itself creates proper security groups for instance to ELB and vice versa rules for http and/https

if you need extra like an ssh connection you can set key auth and provide pub key there and create a security group for ssh connection to the instance

>outbound connections to the internet is required

If your EC2 instances are in a private subnet, verify that the route table associated with the NAT gateway or the NAT instance has a route to the internet. For example: 0.0.0.0/0

>/var/log/eb-cfn-init.log for checking what went wrong in the instance deployed via elasticbeanstalk

>custom AMIs can cause unexpected behavior

the correct way of creating a custom for Beanstalk is by deploying a Beanstalk AMI to EC2, editing it, and then saving it and deploying to Beanstalk. (will try this method)

>if any changes were made in the elastic beanstalk it will be gone after autoscaling

>app names should be unique

>errors that happened during the creation time of the environment is reported in events but for detailed log check
/var/log/eb-cfn-init.log in the deployed instance

>elb type can only be selected during creation time

can migrate from a single instance to clb but can't change elb type

by default, you can use alb for load balancing



Deploying
------------

When deployed via eb-cli within the docker container

1. cloned the git from the gitlab

2. cloned files uploaded to s3 via eb-cli as a zip file

3. the aws cred location used here is default and the env set here for using the default location, you can change it

3. the image I created contained ssh key pair for authenticating with gitlab
   eb-cli installed and configured
   the image is currently in the docker hub
   
4. after the eb-cli uploaded the files are then to the app server
the process looks automated need to check this further

after files are copied to app server the deployment will complete
